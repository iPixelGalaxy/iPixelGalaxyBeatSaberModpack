# iPixelGalaxy Beat Saber Modpack

# How to Install (BSManager)
1. Download and install BSManager [here](https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager/releases).
2. Once setup download the version you wish to mod. (At the time of writing I suggest 1.40.6)
3. Click the "Mods" tab in BSManager and Install the "JDFixer" and "DiTails" mods as those are not included at the request of modders, this will also grab every dependency not included in the modpack.
4. Launch the game once, *before installing the modpack*. (This ensures that all mods are moved from IPA/Pending), alternatively, move them manually.
5. Close the game and click the settings gear in BSManager and click "Open Folder".
6. Drag and drop the folders provided in [BeatSaberModpack.zip](https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/iPixelGalaxy-Beat-Saber-Modpack/releases) and click "Replace the files in the destination".
7. You should be good to go now!

# Optional Steps for Quality of Life (BSManager)
1. After you've installed everything, you can click Settings -> "Shared Folders" and link any folders you wish to share across game versions. Simply Click "Add Folder" and select the folder you wish to add.
2. Repeat this for every folder you wish to link. My suggestions are UserData, CustomSabers, Playlists, CustomSubRain and CustomMenuSongs if you only plan to use the mods included in the modpack.
4. After this is done, any new versions you download, you'll be able to click "Link all" and every folder you've linked will be made automatically.
5. All of your Beat Saber folders will then be shared across versions!

# Modpack Benefits

# How to Install (Manual Method) (Fresh Install)

2. Open Mod Assistant and Install the "JDFixer" and "DiTails" mods as those are not included at the request of modders, this will also grab every dependency not included in the modpack.
3. Extract the contents of BeatSaberModpack.zip to the root of your Beat Saber Install typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber. And click "Replace the files in the destination"
4. You should be done. Enjoy! And if you have any issues let me know in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/6nmXVPtNA6) and I'll try my best to sort out your problems üòÄ
