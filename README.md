# iPixelGalaxy Beat Saber Modpack

# BSManager Method Highly Reccomended

# How to Install (Manual Method) (Fresh Install)
1. Download Latest Modpack [Release 1.29.0-1.29.1](https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/iPixelGalaxy-Beat-Saber-Modpack/releases/latest/download/BeatSaberModpack.zip)
2. Open Mod Assistant and Install the "More Playlists" mod as well as "JDFixer" and "Intro Skip" as those are not included at the request of modders, this will also grab every dependency not included in the modpack.
3. Extract the contents of BeatSaberModpack.zip to the root of your Beat Saber Install typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber
4. You should be done. Enjoy! And if you have any issues let me know in my [discord server](https://discord.gg/6nmXVPtNA6) and I'll try my best to sort out your problems ðŸ˜€

# How to Install (BSManager)
1. Download and install BSManager [here](https://github.com/Zagrios/bs-manager/releases).
2. Once setup download the version you wish to mod. (At the time of writing I suggest 1.29.1)
3. Click the "Mods" tab in BSManager and Install the "More Playlists" mod as well as "JDFixer" and "Intro Skip" as those are not included at the request of modders, this will also grab every dependency not included in the modpack.
4. Launch the game once, *before installing the modpack*. (This ensures that all mods are moved from IPA/Pending)
5. Close the game and click the settings gear in BSManager and click "Open Folder".
6. Drag and drop the folders provided in [BeatSaberModpack.zip](https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/iPixelGalaxy-Beat-Saber-Modpack/releases)
7. You should be good to go now!

# Optional Steps for Quality of Life (BSManager)
1. After you've installed everything, you can click Settings -> "Shared Folders" and link any folders you wish to share across game versions. Simply Click "Add Folder" and select the folder you wish to add.
2. Repeat this for every folder you wish to link. My suggestions are UserData, CustomSabers, Playlists, CustomSubRain and CustomMenuSongs if you only plan to use the mods included in the modpack.
4. After this is done, any new versions you download, you'll be able to click "Link all" and every folder you've linked will be made automatically.
5. All of your Beat Saber folders will then be shared across versions!

# How to Install (BSLegacyLauncher)
1. Download BSLegacyLauncher by [RiskiVR](https://riskivr.com/) The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/RiskiVR/BSLegacyLauncher/releases)
2. Extract and place the Launcher in the root of one of your drives. e.g. You should end up with something like C:\BSLegacyLauncher (I suggest you put it on SSD for best Loading Times/Performance).
3. Create a Shortcut to the launcher, then Right Click the shortcut and click Properties. Add --pixel after the quotation marks on the highlighted line when you click Properties. (With BSLegacy 1.7.0 there is now also a flag to prevent your Plugins folder from ever being renamed that I would suggest adding "--no-yeet".) As Such:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42526028/210357257-a8736d27-685d-457e-ba02-9706826bb49f.png)
4. Use this shortcut to launch the launcher as it will add the one click button for mods in Advanced Settings (you can copy it to your desktop or drag it to your taskbar).
5. Download a copy of Beat Saber (whatever the latest version of the pack is available).
6. After it's done downloading, hit back, then hit Advanced Settings.
7. Click "BSIPA 4".
8. Click "Pixel's Modpack" and wait for a few seconds while it downloads and installs it to your game.
9. Done! I would suggest looking at the Optional Steps for Quality of Life below if you want to utilize the full power of the launcher to save space *and* make updating extremely easy.

# Optional Steps for Quality of Life (BSLegacyLauncher)
1. After you've installed everything, you can click "Shared Folders" and select CustomLevels, CustomWIPLevels (and DLC if you have any and want to move it over from your existing install). Click Create Folders.
2. Next comes the tedious part (one time setup tho), you can type in every other folder you would want to link. My suggestions are UserData, CustomSabers, Playlists, CustomSubRain and CustomMenuSongs if you only plan to use the mods included in the modpack.
3. Type each name (one at a time) and click Create Folders.
4. After this is done, any new versions you download, you'll be able to click "Relink Folders" and every folder name you've entered before will be made automatically.
5. All of your Beat Saber folders will then be shared across versions!

# How to Update (If you did the QoL Steps for BSLegacyLauncher)
1. Download the Latest Version of Beat Saber.
2. Install BSIPA 4 in Advanced Settings.
3. Relink Folders.
4. Hit the "Pixel's Mods" button in advanced settings.
5. Enjoy game ðŸ™‚

BSLegacy Utility Support Discord can be found [here](https://discord.gg/MrwMx5e) Don't go there for support with the modpack tho, come to my discord server [here](https://discord.gg/6nmXVPtNA6) and if it's something that's a launcher issue I will forward it to Riski!

I also want to say a great thanks to Riski for integrating my modpack as a one click install button into the launcher even tho it's for such a small group of people! ðŸ˜€
